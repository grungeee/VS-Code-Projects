// Coding Challenge #2
// Let's go back to Julia and Kate's study about dogs. This time, they want to convert
// dog ages to human ages and calculate the average age of the dogs in their study.
// Your tasks:
// Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge', which accepts an arrays of dog's
// ages ('ages'), and does the following things in order:
// 1. Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula: if the dog is
// <= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge. If the dog is > 2 years old,
// humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4
// 2. Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old (which is the same as
// keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old)
// 3. Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs (you should already know
// from other challenges how we calculate averages �)
// 4. Run the function for both test datasets
// Test data:
// § Data 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
// § Data 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]

const data1 = [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3];

function clacAverageHumanAge(ages) {
  const humanAges = ages.map(age =>
    //: Calculating dogs age -> in human years
    age <= 2 ? 2 * age : 16 + age * 4
  );
  //: Excluding all dogs that are less then 18 human years
  const adultDogsInHY = humanAges.filter(age => age >= 18);
  //: Calculating the everage of human age of all adult dogs
  const avgAdultDogsInHY =
    // adultDogsInHY.reduce((acc, age, i, arr) => acc + age, 0) /
    // adultDogsInHY.length;
    adultDogsInHY.reduce((acc, age, i, arr) => acc + age / arr.length, 0); //: Alternative way but not as efficient

  //> tests
  console.log(humanAges);
  console.log(adultDogsInHY);
  console.log(avgAdultDogsInHY);
}

clacAverageHumanAge(data1);
//& It is also possible to chain everything 😄
